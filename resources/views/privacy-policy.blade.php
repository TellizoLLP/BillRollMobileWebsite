                    <p>BillRoll is an offline-first application. <strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data</strong> to our servers or any third-party clouds.</p>
                    <p class="mt-4">All data entered into the application (including business details, client information, and invoices) is stored exclusively on your device's local storage.</p>

                    <p>Your data resides locally on your Android device. We have no access to your data. The security of your data depends on the physical security of your device and any device-level security measures you have enabled (such as screen locks or encryption).</p>

                    <p>Since we do not collect your data, we cannot and do not share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties. Data only leaves your device if you voluntarily share it (e.g., by emailing an invoice PDF to a client).</p>
